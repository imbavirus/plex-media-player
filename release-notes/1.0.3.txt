NEW:
- Updated Qt to version 5.6.0 beta. This replaces the Alpha version we had before. Many stability and preformance improvements.
- Windows - Added setting to disable native OpenGL. If you are having display problems or crashes on windows, please try our DirectX mode.
- Added a lot of information to the debug overlay vsync-ratio, audio passthrough, OpenGL version, display status etc.
- List IPv6 host addresses on debug overlay.
- Windows - PMP doesn't minimize when it loses focus anymore. We have reverted back to the old behaviour, that means that if you are
  in native OpenGL mode you can't alt-tab out of the window. We are going to try to improve this in the future.
- Added support for host command script that can execute a script. Put a script in the scripts datadir and call
  host script script.py from the inputmap.
- Updated seek and step keyboard mapping. 
- Added a command to switch display modes.
- Added host commands for suspend, reboot and power off.
- Added setting to disable logging.
