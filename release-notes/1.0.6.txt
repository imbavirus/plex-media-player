NEW:
  - Search! There is now global search in PMP. It's early days and doesn't work well with keyboards yet.
  - Manual check for new version in Main settings (no need to restart to check for new version).
  - Embedded version now based on OpenELEC 6.0.3 which supports newer NUC's and the Raspberry PI3
  
FIXED:
  - The "three dots" indicating buffering could stick around for a very long time. We fixed that.
  - MPEG-2 video direct playback is now working correctly
  - Switching servers from the dashboard is no longer slow
  - A variety of smaller fixes in the web-client
  - PMP will now open on the same physcial screen it was on last
  - Various resizing issues has been fixed where PMP could be stuck at very small size
